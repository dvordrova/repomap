# Cumulative language repositories

This directory contains exactly one small real repository for each language
covered by repository-discovery and ProgramIndex regression tests. A future
repository-dependent regression extends the existing repository for that
language only after owner approval; it does not create one repository per bug.
Every tracked file has an exact inventory entry under `testdata/contracts`.

The fixtures deliberately contain no nested `.git` directory, generated
binary, product command, helper script, network requirement, or third-party
runtime dependency. Test harnesses may copy a fixture to a temporary directory
and initialize source-control metadata there when tracked-file behavior is
part of the contract.

These fixtures stop after deterministic indexing. Model-backed behavior such
as batching, closed-ref normalization, cache validation, and grouping belongs
in smaller cube or executor tests unless a separately approved regression
really depends on repository shape. If a future repository test must cross a
provider boundary, it uses an exact request-bound, fail-closed local preset
with no network access.

These repositories are regression evidence, not product acceptance. Ordinary
online runs against real repositories remain the acceptance path.

Current language repositories:

- `go/` proves the ordinary Go orientation handoff through an imported local
  package. Its unused private receiver method remains a ProgramIndex object but
  never gains a DirectCall node that was not observed.
- `python/` proves the complete PEP 621 `src`-layout script chain from target
  discovery through a validated, round-tripped ProgramIndex with one exact
  `main` script seed.
- `jsts/` proves the selected-package TypeScript compiler path for local and
  JavaScript default-library invocations. DOM canvas calls, `Math`, `console`,
  `Date`, `Promise`, and `Image` retain exact platform authority; a class
  construction retains its exact local constructor, while a repository-local
  value merely typed as a platform constructor remains an unresolved frontier.
